# Hippo Race Game

A fun, interactive web-based racing game where you choose a hippo and race against AI opponents by answering animal trivia questions!

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Hippo**: Select from 4 unique hippos, each with different stats:
   - **Thunder**: Fast and steady (High speed, moderate bonus)
   - **Lightning**: High risk, high reward (Lower speed, highest bonus multiplier)
   - **Splash**: Consistent performer (Highest speed, lowest bonus)
   - **Bubbles**: Balanced all-arounder (Balanced stats)

2. **Answer Trivia Questions**: Each turn, you'll be asked an animal-themed trivia question with multiple choice answers.

3. **Build Your Streak**:
   - Answer 2 questions correctly in a row to unlock a HARD QUESTION!
   - Hard questions are more challenging but reward 1.5x bonus multiplier
   - Your current streak is displayed with a fire emoji ðŸ”¥
   - Streak resets after a hard question or wrong answer

4. **Race to the Finish**:
   - All hippos move forward each turn
   - If you answer correctly, your hippo gets a speed boost based on its bonus multiplier
   - Wrong answers mean your hippo moves at base speed only

5. **Win the Race**: First hippo to reach the finish line wins!
