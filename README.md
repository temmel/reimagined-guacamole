# Hippo Race Game

A fun, interactive web-based racing game where you choose a hippo and race against AI opponents by answering animal trivia questions!

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Hippo**: Select from 4 unique hippos, each with different stats:
   - **Thunder**: Fast and steady (High speed, moderate bonus)
   - **Lightning**: High risk, high reward (Lower speed, highest bonus multiplier)
   - **Splash**: Consistent performer (Highest speed, lowest bonus)
   - **Bubbles**: Balanced all-arounder (Balanced stats)

2. **Answer Trivia Questions**: Questions alternate between EASY and HARD difficulty:
   - **Turn 1, 3, 5...** = EASY questions (Ages 6-9)
   - **Turn 2, 4, 6...** = HARD questions (Ages 10-13)
   - Answer choices are randomized each time

3. **Race to the Finish**:
   - All hippos move forward each turn
   - If you answer correctly, your hippo gets a speed boost based on its bonus multiplier
   - Wrong answers mean your hippo moves at base speed only
   - AI opponents move at their base speed with slight random variance

4. **Win the Race**: First hippo to reach the finish line wins!
